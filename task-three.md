### Details



Like every good programming language Ruby understands basic Math easily. It knows that `2 + 2` is `4` and how PEMDAS works. Math is an important part of programming, but it's not required that you be a math genius. In fact most math programming you'll be doing will probably be the basic kind. With that said it's always good to know a few shortcuts!
