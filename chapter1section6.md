## [Credits & Licensing](id:section-six)
Alright, you've gotten through the boring part of the book. You know about Ruby, the history, and some of the pitfalls of the community. You're equipped, now, to start learning Ruby and building applications. Hopefully you can start understand why I've written this guide, especially this way, once you get into Ruby developing on your own. This book is of course not the last thing you'll read. In fact you should go on to read these great books, because they inspired me to write this:

* [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) (Read Chapter 1 first, then you can read either book.)
* [Poignant Guide To Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/) (Written in an odd but fun way.)
* [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (Also free and web/pdf)
* [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) (Also free and web/pdf)
* [Programming Ruby](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/) (Not free/Web)
* [Learn You A Haskell For Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
* [Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good](http://learnyousomeerlang.com/)
* [Learning Clojure](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_Clojure)
