## [The Cherry Kool-Aid](id:section-five)
Like many geek cultures that exist today the programming communities tend to have a very common problem: Power users, fanboys, and evangelists. Fanatics of a religion, political party, or creed have always existed and the programming culture is no less afflicted by them. In fact due to the social ineptitude many geeks live with we are more prone to the red haze of cultism. You're mistaken if you think I'm joking when I say that there have been actual fist fights over which indentation style to use in C, or what command line editor to write with. Despite the Hacker culture's focus on individuality and freedom, the Ruby world is still a geek world.

Ever since Rails rolled out the Ruby community has stepped knee deep in hype and hyperbole. It started off as lot of programmers becoming very enthusiastic about a new and expressive language. It didn't help that the community had a lot of early Rock Stars emerging from Rails, and that they talked a lot of smack about other languages. Many touted Ruby as the Great White Hope of Programming. It's a general consensus among Rubyits that the egotism and dickery comes directly from Rails's growth.

The reality here is that geeks of any flavor tend to gush over new toys and geeks of any flavor tend to rant about others gushing. In recent years the type of behavior described has slowly ground to a halt as the fanatics are pushed aside and the community, and language, matures. It is important to realize that his behavior stems from ignorance and the best cure is education. We as a group cannot abide by this blind fervor because it will ultimately ruin a lot of what Ruby stands for: The enjoyment of developing.
