## [The Ruby Revolution & Renaissance](id:section-three)
Now that you know what Ruby is (or at least the definition of Ruby) and how it started, it's time to learn about the history. The era, called the _Ruby Revolution_ by some, of most significance started in 2004. The Ruby Revolution concerns the period of time where Rails hit the scene and started to cause a fuss among web developers. The "fuss" would be called _Ruby Philosophy_. The core philosophy behind Ruby is "DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself". During this time period you can see at least three sides forming in the web development community: The older fellows who liked what they had (JavaEE, PHP) and didn't think this new fangled Ruby On Rails was worth the change, the younger developers who quite enjoyed the ease Rails and Ruby gave them, and those that didn't care either way.

While web development and web frameworks existed long before Rails, it was commonly considered that web application development sucked. It was something you had to really plow through without much help. The idea that web development could be significantly easier made a lot of people happy. Of course, Ruby and Rails wasn't (and isn't) perfect, but it was the initial push toward making things easier that mattered. The thing is the Ruby Revolution wouldn't have happened without the success of Ruby On Rails with American developers. Thanks to the Rails phenomenon the number of Ruby developers in the United states and European Union grew by incredible amounts. Even though there is an even smaller divide among Rubyists on Rails, we owe a lot of Ruby's following and popularity to Rails.

As with all revolutions there had to end, and it did end around the year 2009. Though while the _Ruby Revolution_ ended many claimed that 2010 will be the start of the _Ruby Renaissance_. An era for Ruby to refine many aspects of the language and it's parts. At the end of 2009 Ruby already had four variations, the beginning of a Standard, and the rise of three other major web frameworks beyond Rails. More importantly many companies were (and are) specifically hiring Ruby and Ruby On Rails developers.

A lot of articles have been written and will be written about the Ruby Revolution and the change that Ruby has made in the web development area. It's a good idea to keep in mind that Ruby's Revolution and Renaissance didn't sprout from a void. The real source of Ruby's success is you, future developers and users.
